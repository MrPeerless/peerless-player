        <h2>Latest Release: Version 0.3.3</h2>
        <h3>January 2022 - What's New</h3>
        <div class="divSingle">
            <p><b>Release Date: 18.01.2022</b></p>
            <p>Minor update to improve metadata search functions when adding/editing an album. During final testing, metadata was found for 90% of the albums. Of the remaining 10%; 4% had no track metadata, 2% had no album metadata and 4% had no metadata at all.</p><br />
            <p>Further analysis showed that of this 10% of failures; 60% had no data in the various databases searched and the remaining 40% had data, but could not be found by the algorithm.</p><br />
            <p>This effectively now gives the album metadata search algorithm a 96% success rate.</p><br />
            <p>Album artwork is now searched for on 2 databases to increase the success rate for searching for artwork. During final testing 96% of the album artwork was found.</p><br />
            <p>Some minor bug fixes on page layouts.</p><br />

        <h2>Last Main Release: Version 0.3.0</h2>
        <h3>June 2021 - What's New</h3>
        <div class="divSingle">
            <p><b>Release Date: 08.06.2021</b></p>
            <p>The main update has been rewriting the code for importing and editing music since the termination of the Gracenote Free Open Developer Program. There will be some small changes in the process of importing or updating metadata in the database now using the Musicbrainz and Spotify APIs.</p><br />
            <p>Unfortunately, I have had to remove the Recommendations function since the termination of my Gracenote licence. Don't worry, this will return in a future update.</p><br />
            <p>Support has been added to now play hi-def lossless FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files.</p><br />
            <p>A new algorithm has been developed to determine the most played albums. Currently the algorithm is very simplistic and just counts the number of track plays per album. The new algorithm uses the following formula: <code>(album track plays/no. tracks) * (1 + album length / 2700)</code>, which adds a weighting for the length of the album to give more accurate results.</p><br />
            <p>The search function is being rewritten using SQL FTS5, which will deliver a list of results based on most relevant results to the search query.</p><br />
            <p>The album sort is being updated to include sorting by album Release Date and the sorting will apply globally across the app wherever a list of albums is displayed.</p><br />
            <p>As well, there are numerous small bug fixes, which are listed in the release notes under the Help menu in the app.</p>

        <h2>Gracenote Termination</h2>
        <h3>April 2021 - Gracenote Terminate My Licence</h3>
        <div class="divSingle">
            <p>Since 2013, when I first started building this app in python3, I have been using the Gracenote Free Open Developer Program, which allowed developers to use the Gracenote web API to query their database and retrieve music metadata and album artwork.</p><br />
            <p>In mid April I suddenly began receiving error messages whenever my app contacted the Gracenote servers. Upon investigation of the error code sent back, I found out that my licence had expired.</p><br />
            <p>At first I thought that this was an oversight on my behalf, as I have always received an annual email from Gracenote for me to log into my account and renew my licence. I went to their website to log in, but my account details were no longer valid. I checked my emails, but there were no emails from Gracenote.</p><br />
            <p>Upon contacting Gracenote I was informed that the free Open Developer Program had been discontinued and that they now only licence access to the web API for a monthly subscription, starting at $3,500 a month.</p><br />
            <p>So, after 8 years I had to sit down and research where to get music metadata from. To the rescue came the Musicbrainz and the Spotify web API's, which is now being incorporated into release version 0.3.0.</p>
