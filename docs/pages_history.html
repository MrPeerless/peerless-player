        <h2>Development Background</h2>
        <br />
        <p>I started this project back in 2013 because I was not happy using either Windows Media Player or iTunes to play my music collection. I wanted an app that I could organise my music library the way I wanted and so I started to code my own app.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            This project has been written in 3 languages during the course of it's evolution. I started using Python 3, but became frustrated after a few years with the limited GUI elements I had available to use. I thought if only I had the power of HTML5 and CSS3 I could design a responsive and good looking GUI. So I started the second evolution redesigning the app as a web app using a Chronium browser, which used the power of HTML5 and CSS3 and switching languages from Python 3 to C# and Javascript.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            Again the web app had it's limitations. To run on a PC it had to run off a local server and was difficult to deploy as a downloadable app. Working in a browser sandboxed the app from accessing the local directory, which restricted operations on the locally stored music directory. I needed to find a better option to create a native desktop app.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            In 2018 I discovered Electron and started this, the third evolution of this app. Electron is a framework using a Chronium browser and Node.js to create native desktop applications using web technologies. Once more I began redesigning the app switching languages from C# to Javascript. It is now a downloadable Windows app, with automatic updates using the power of Javascript, HTML5 and CSS3 on the front end and Node.js on the back end.
